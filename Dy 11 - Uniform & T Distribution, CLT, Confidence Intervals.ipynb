    "# The Uniform Distribution\n",
    "Uniform Distribution describes an event where every possible outcome is equally likely. \n",
    "No single outcome carries any more or less probability of happening than any other possible outcome. \n",
    "The Uniform Distribution can be discrete or continuous. Mostly used to be discrete.\n",
    "has an upper limit and lower limit\n",
    "we use PMF since it is discrete.\n",

    "# Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "Confidence intervals - are a tool that allows us to give a more formal answer questions, and they form the basis for the statistical testing (hypothesis testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "allows us to treat non-normal distributions as normal distributions and provides a way for us to estimate parameters about a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values surrounding an estimated parameter. \n",
    "The width of the range depends on the variance of the data (more variance results in a wider confidence interval, less variance in a narrower confidence interval) as well as the confidence level (a higher confidence level results in a wider confidence interval, lower confidence level results in a narrower confidence interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The t-Distribution\n",
    "Initial confidence intervals use the z-distribution \n",
    "The t-distribution allows us to work with samples where the population standard deviation is unknown (as well as smaller samples), in order to form confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "CLT states that, under many conditions, independent random variables summed together will converge to a normal distribution as the number of variables increases.\n",
    "population parameters arer like mean, standard deviation\n",
